# FTH Program – Website PRD for Spark

This document provides Spark with structured context to generate premium, user‑facing marketing and explainer content for the FTH Program website.

---

## 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** FTH Program  
**Tagline Direction Options:**  
• “XRPL-Native Stable, Rewards, and Gold Rail”  
• “Membership-Based Stablecoin & Gold Platform with On-Chain Proof-of-Reserves”  

**One-Line Description (seed for Spark):**  
FTH is a membership-based financial program built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) that combines a fiat-backed balance (FTHUSD), closed-loop rewards (USDF), discounted gold purchases, and transparent on-chain Proof-of-Reserves into a single, easy-to-use member experience.

Spark should produce engaging, premium marketing copy that explains FTH simply while hinting at the sophisticated infrastructure behind it.

---

## 2. Objectives of the Page

Spark should generate a page that:
1. Explains what FTH is (non-technical clarity).
2. Describes day-to-day member use (fund, earn, buy gold, verify reserves).
3. Highlights trust & transparency (Proof-of-Reserves, risk controls).
4. Conveys technical credibility (XRPL, EVM, Chainlink) without overwhelming.
5. Positions FTH as premium, compliant, future-ready (not hype / meme).

---

## 3. Target Audience

**Primary:** High‑net‑worth members seeking stable value storage, rewards, gold access; crypto‑aware users preferring XRPL’s speed / low fees.

**Secondary:** Partners (fintechs, platforms, metals dealers, banks) exploring XRPL-native rails; sophisticated users valuing PoR and regulatory alignment.

**Tone:** Confident, explanatory, slightly premium. No hype, memes, or jargon dumps.

---

## 4. Brand Voice & Style

**Voice:** Calm, trustworthy, expert (“built carefully”, not “changing everything tomorrow”).  
**Reading Level:** Intelligent but approachable (premium financial landing page).  
**Style Keywords:** Institutional, clean, modern, transparent, precise.

---

## 5. Key Concepts for Spark

**FTHUSD:** Fiat‑backed balance on XRPL; stable, 1:1 intention, fast settlement, redeemable conceptually via platform on/off‑ramps.

**USDF:** Closed‑loop rewards credit (membership rewards, not transferable yield); used for perks, loyalty structures.

**Gold Integration:** Discounted gold/metals orders using FTHUSD; delivery or buyback fulfillment conceptually bridging digital balance to physical asset.

**Membership NFTs:** Represent member status/tier; act as a membership card enabling benefits.

**Proof-of-Reserves (PoR):** On-chain snapshots (coverage ratio, assets vs liabilities); anchored on XRPL and stored in EVM registry via Chainlink for verifiable trust.

**XRPL + EVM Infrastructure:** XRPL core ledger (balances/NFTs); EVM sidecar + Chainlink for price feeds & PoR registry; described as institutional-grade architecture.

## 6. Page Structure & Section Guidance

### 6.1 Hero Section

**Goal:** Immediate clarity + premium positioning.

**Elements for Spark:**

- Headline example: “Your XRPL-Native Membership Balance, Rewards, and Gold Rail.”
- Subheadline: FTHUSD stable balance + USDF rewards + discounted gold + on-chain PoR.
- Bullet highlights: Fiat‑backed program balance; Membership rewards credits (USDF); Discounted gold orders; Transparent Proof-of-Reserves.

### 6.2 “How Members Use FTH” Journey

1. **Join & Verify:** KYC + activate membership NFT/profile.
2. **Load FTHUSD:** Fund balance via conceptual bank/off‑ramp (no specific partners claimed).
3. **Earn USDF Rewards:** Participation generates rewards credits (not yield promises).
4. **Buy Discounted Gold:** Use FTHUSD for discounted metals; track orders; delivery or buyback options.
5. **Check Proof-of-Reserves:** View coverage (e.g., 104–105%); link to on-chain snapshot.

Each step should have a concise benefit‑oriented paragraph.

### 6.3 “Why XRPL & EVM” Section

Explain:

- XRPL: High throughput, low fees, native issued currencies & NFTs (ideal for stable balances + membership tokens).
- EVM + Chainlink: External price feeds, PoR registry, historical anchoring, audit facilitation.

### 6.4 Trust & Transparency / PoR

Emphasize:

- Regular PoR snapshots (assets, liabilities, coverage ratio).  
- Storage: EVM PoR registry + XRPL transaction memos.  
- Purpose: Verifiable reserves beyond promises.

### 6.5 “Who FTH Is For”

Split:
**Members:** Stable digital balances, rewards, metals access, fast settlement, transparency.  
**Partners:** XRPL-native rails, prebuilt program logic (PoR + membership), reduced time-to-market.

### 6.6 “Under the Hood” (Light Technical Credibility)

Mention (non-exhaustive):

- XRPL for balances, NFTs, on-ledger operations.
- EVM + Chainlink for PoR registry and price feeds.
- Off-chain services (KYC/AML, bonus engine, gold ops, treasury).  
- Multi-signature governance; conservative payment rules (no partial payments, no pathfinding); DEX usage controls.
Tone: Infrastructure complexity abstracted away for user simplicity.

### 6.7 Call-to-Action / Next Steps

Potential CTAs: “Join the FTH Program” / “Request Early Access” / “Talk to Us About Integration” / “Book a Call.”  
Invite both members (pre-register / learn more) and partners (explore integration).

---

## 7. Visual & UX Guidance (High-Level)

Suggest descriptive visuals (no design files):

- Hero dashboard mock: FTHUSD balance, USDF rewards widget, gold discount tile.
- PoR coverage widget (e.g., “104.8% coverage”).
- Membership NFT card preview.  
Design tone: Dark or muted institutional palette; clean typography; generous whitespace.

---

## 8. Non-Goals / Avoid

Spark must NOT:

- Promise specific yields, interest, or guaranteed returns.
- Dive into licensing/legal minutiae.
- Use hype/meme language.
- Over-explain XRPL/EVM internals.

Page should feel like a serious financial product site—not speculative trading.

---

## 9. Delivery Expectation for Spark

Generate: Hero copy, section headings, explanatory paragraphs, polished bullet lists, CTA lines, optional alt text for conceptual visuals. Keep consistent with voice guidelines.

This PRD gives Spark the structured context needed to produce coherent, premium marketing and explainer content for the FTH Program website.
